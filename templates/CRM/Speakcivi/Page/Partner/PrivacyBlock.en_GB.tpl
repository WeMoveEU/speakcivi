<p style="font-size:11px;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">At WeMove Europe we take your privacy very seriously. Your participation in our campaigns and consent to receive more campaign emails are entirely voluntary. By clicking the link “Please send me updates!” you are supporting our petition and agreeing to receive further campaign emails (“newsletter”) from WeMove Europe. We might hand over your name, surname and country to the petition target - that way we can prove that there is a real person behind your signature, and protect your privacy by keeping the information we share to a minimum. Unless you agree to receive personalised updates from WeMove Europe and our partner organisations, or if you click the link “I don’t want to be informed”, we will use your data exclusively as necessary for this campaign, and delete it after the campaign has ended. We might share your data with our partner organisations and they might contact you, but we will never share your data with any third parties without your permission. If you agree to receive our campaign emails, we might use your data as well as information about how you interact with our emails (e.g. the language you speak, the links you click) to make sure the emails you receive are interesting and personalised. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 section 1 a) (for the campaign emails or “newsletter”) and b) (for a petition signature) EU General Data Protection Regulation or for the European Citizens’ Initiative the EU Regulation No. 211/2011 on the European Citizens’ Initiative. The data will be stored for as long as your consent remains valid. As soon as your consent is withdrawn, you will no longer receive a newsletter from us and your data will be deleted. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. WeMove Europe SCE mbH is legally the “controller” of the data. We use a data processor whom we instruct to send you our campaign emails on our behalf.</p>
